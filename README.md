hackaton
========

A private repo for our hackathon.
Our app is a smart search for movies (netflix, imdb, rotten-tomatoes)

Folder Structure:
	index.php	- the main front-end file that loads/includes everything
	layouts/	- the html pages and page-components
	js/			- javascript; 3rd party libraries and custom code
	css/		- style sheets
	images/		- assets and images (svg and jpg files, backgrounds icons, etc.)

	includes/	- reusable php files; most of the algo and db stuff go here
	ajax/		- php "endpoints" that usually just return data when navigated to
	db/			- sqlite schema and other files. usually one-time-only

	docs/		- txt and doc files to describe complex components
	res/		- other resources and downloaded files we were too lazy to delete
