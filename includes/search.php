/* Perform a basic search, return an array of matching movies.

In the basic search you can specify a set of properties of the movie. These are:
- title
- year
- director
- actor
(This is what I see documented at the moment, if I find more I will add it here...)

The $searchString can be any combination of these and should look like::

	keyword1=value&keyword2=value

For example:

	title=The%20Boondocks&year=2005
